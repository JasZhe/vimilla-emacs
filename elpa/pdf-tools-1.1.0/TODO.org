#+TITLE: A list of important / desirable tasks

* pdf-isearch
** TODO Allow for entering multi-byte characters with some input-methods.
The PDF buffer is in uni-byte mode. It prohibits the user from inserting multi-byte characters in the minibuffer with some input-methods, while editing the search string.
* pdf-forms
** TODO Add support for editing forms
Recent poppler versions have some support for editing forms.
* pdf-annot
** TODO Add support for free-text annotations
** TODO Updating the annot list buffer is too slow
+ Update it incrementally.
+ Possibly skip the update if the buffer is not visible.
* epdfinfo
** TODO Maybe split the code up in several files.
* pdf-view
** TODO Provide some kind of multi-page view
** TODO Make persistent scrolling relative
Currently the scrolling is kept when changing the image's size (in ~pdf-view-display-image~), which is actually not so desirable, since it is absolute. This results e.g. in the image popping out of the window, when it is shrunken.
* pdf-info
** TODO Add a report/debug command
- Display a list of open files
- Display ~pdf-tools~ version as reported by ~package.el~
- Display custom configuration for ~pdf-tools~ (how?)
** TODO Use alists for results instead of positional lists.
